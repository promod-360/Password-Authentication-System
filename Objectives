# Password-Authentication-System
Implement a basic authentication system using 8086 Assembly that validates username and password.  Demonstrate the use of DOS interrupts (INT 21h) for handling string output, character input, and program control.  Develop subroutines for input reading and string comparison to mimic secure login functionality.   8086 Assembly Language Programming
